> Data Flow Document - Using *Whimsical* make a document that shows the data flow between your front-end and back-end, with component hierarchy added. 


>API Snippet - A sample snippet of JSON from a *successful* request made in Postman 


>Wireframes - A mockup of the application's views - Desktop and Mobile - API/DB 


>MVP - A list of features that  you need to meet the minimum viable product. These are the essential functions that must be prioritized against the rest of the app's features

## Planning 
  * Have our Team Expectations table complete 
  * Have a complete and nice looking ```README.md``` file
  * Take the time for each team member to discuss where they feel strongest and weakest, in terms of coding ability.
  * Complete the Whimsical Dataflow Document above 
  * Delete this section when project is complete 

## Collaboration
  * Contribute equally
  * Have a solid understanding of the entire project even if its features were done by other teammates
  * Take time to do pair-programming with teammates to reinforce learning
  * Be prepared to explain sections of code written by teammates.
  * Delete this section when project is complete
  
## Client 
  * Have a working, interactive React app, built using ```npx create-react-app client``` 
    * Have at least 6 different, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure
    * Use functional and class React components appropriately 
    * Use only React for DOM Manipulation
  * Consume data from your API and render that data in your components
  * Use React-Router for client-side routing.
  * Authentication 
  * Landing Screen 
  * Listing Screen 
  * Detail Screen 
### Kheyyon's Client Spice (THESE ARE MVP GOALS - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  * Add an error boundary page for results that fall outside of the web sites routes/paths
  * Lazy Load all components - no static imports 

## Server
  * Have working full-CRUD controller actions via Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB
  * Authentication 

### Kheyyon's Server Spice (THESE ARE MVP GOALS - NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  * Make a custom method that overrides Express's send method
  * Make a custom middleware that allows us access to the specific user making a request
  * Test at least 4 different API routes via a testing framework
  * Give users a profile image 
  * Add custom validators to our Schemas *Mongoose's built-in validators + Custom Validators*
  * Create at least one reference within you Mongoose Schema to use 

## Styling
  * Be styled with TailwindCSS, SASS, and/or SCSS
  * Use flexbox (```display:flex```) or CSS Grid (For Layout Purposes - Only Vanilla CSS Allowed)
  * Create responsive design on 3 screen sizes (Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile) using CSS Media Query 

## Linting
  * Indent Properly
  * Use semantic names (Variable names should make sense)
  * Follow ```camelCase```, ```snake_case``` and ```kebab-case``` convention when appropriate
  * Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code
  * Remove all console.log()s and commented out code (functional notes/comments are okay).

## Deployment
  * Deploy the fully functional front-end via Netlify 
  * Deploy the back-end to Heroku
  * Deploy the MongoDB database on MongoDB Atlas
 
## Procedural
  * Everyone should be making frequent commits to the project from the very start! Commits must meet or exceed *50* total 
  * Use effective and safe branching and merging practices
  


>Post-MVP - A list of extra features that you add to the project after MVP


>Goals - What would you like to complete each day of the project week?


>Priority Matrix - A graph of intended areas of development on an X/Y graph where X = time to complete and Y = priority. Use a professional tool and an image hosting site like cloudinary. 


>Timeframes - how long do you anticipate spending on each area of development? *Each component should be split into a max of 3 hour time block*
